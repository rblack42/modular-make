<h1>Modular Make<a class="headerlink" href="#modular-make" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Read time: 15 minutes (3768 words)</p>
<p>I like to teach programming classes using the command line and standard build
tools. In my teaching experience, I see many students learning programming
using some kind of IDE. Their instructors like the IDE because is is easy to
set up, and that one tool covers all of their programming needs.  However, in
the end these students have little idea how their programs are actually
constructed.  All they ever do is click on one magic button in their IDE to see
if their code will run.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">One school I was involved with almost lost their accreditation because no
student interviewed (and several faculty as well) could explain what
happened when that magic button was clicked!</p>
</div>
<p>Behind the scenes, many IDE systems use the same standard build tools I have my
students use to actually process the code they write and get it running.</p>
<p>There is nothing really wrong with the IDE approach, but my feeling is that
using an IDE is a kind of religious thing. Most IDE tools take some learning to
master, and they require a particular project structure to function. Worse yet,
that structure is often invisible to beginning students, who end up with no
idea where the code they just created lives on their system. My recommendation
is to wait to pick an IDE until you know you will be spending a lot of time
developing software in that system. Since many IDE systems used in a classroom
are not used on the job, the time spend learning that school IDE may well be
wasted when they discover they need to learn another one.</p>
<p>I avoid all of that by focusing on the core build tools. For C/C++ classes, I
use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gnu</span> <span class="pre">Compiler</span> <span class="pre">Collection</span></code> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GCC</span></code>) tools, which are core tools on
all Linux systems. ane same tools are easily installed on Mac and PC systems as
well. I show students how these tools are used to build their programs by
activating them on the command line.</p>
<p>After thay have masterd that style of development, I introduce <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">Make_</span></a>, and the
result is a development workflow that they can use on any machine, from a tiny
Raspberry Pi to a giant supercomputer. If they want to use an IDE after than,
nothing will stop that, and they will better understand what an IDE actually
does.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-make">
<h2>Why Make<a class="headerlink" href="#why-make" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">Make_</span></a> is one of the oldest build tools around. It was developed by Marty
Feldmann back in 1976, who wanted to speed up command line work (that was all
we had back then).His tool did an amazing job of doinf that, and it has been in
use actively ever since. In fact some IDE systems just end up being a wrapper
around <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">Make_</span></a> which does the real work.</p>
<p>Because it is so common, I use <a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">Make_</span></a> rather than one of the newer build tools.
A quick search on <a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">GitHub_</span></a> showed 56 million Makefiles were available for study.
I think that number speaks for itself!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-makefiles">
<h2>Writing Makefiles<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-makefiles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">Make_</span></a> depends on a single text file called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makefile</span></code> to
control what it does. There are many ways to set up <a href="#id14"><span class="problematic" id="id15">Make_</span></a> in a project, and
some end up with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> in every directory. A top-level Makefile can be
used to build an entire project using this scheme. Other developers like one
top-lebel Makefile`` to control every aspect of building and managing their
projects.</p>
<p>Because I teach beginning development courses, I keep to the single
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> style. As the project grows in size, so does the size of this
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>, so I began looking for ways to better manage the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>
itself. It turns out to be easy to do this, but getting things set up for
student use took a bit of research and thinking!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Modular Make<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>WHat I came up with, and this is by no means original to me, is the idea of
breaking up a long <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> into a set of focuses component files, all of
which are included in a single top-level <cite>Makefile`</cite> that ends up fairly small.
Any project can be set up by copying this one file into the right place, then
selecting the <a href="#id16"><span class="problematic" id="id17">Make_</span></a> modules needed for that project.</p>
