I like to teach programming classes using the command line and standard build
tools. In my teaching experience, I see many students learning programming
using some kind of IDE. Their instructors like the IDE because is is easy to
set up, and that one tool covers all of their programming needs.  However, in
the end these students have little idea how their programs are actually
constructed.  All they ever do is click on one magic button in their IDE to see
if their code will run. 

..  note::

    One school I was involved with almost lost their accreditation because no
    student interviewed (and several faculty as well) could explain what
    happened when that magic button was clicked!

Behind the scenes, many IDE systems use the same standard build tools I have my
students use to actually process the code they write and get it running.

There is nothing really wrong with the IDE approach, but my feeling is that
using an IDE is a kind of religious thing. Most IDE tools take some learning to
master, and they require a particular project structure to function. Worse yet,
that structure is often invisible to beginning students, who end up with no
idea where the code they just created lives on their system. My recommendation
is to wait to pick an IDE until you know you will be spending a lot of time
developing software in that system. Since many IDE systems used in a classroom
are not used on the job, the time spend learning that school IDE may well be
wasted when they discover they need to learn another one.

I avoid all of that by focusing on the core build tools. For C/C++ classes, I
use the ``Gnu Compiler Collection`` (``GCC``) tools, which are core tools on
all Linux systems. are same tools are easily installed on Mac and PC systems as
well. I show students how these tools are used to build their programs by
activating them on the command line.

After thay have mastered that style of development, I introduce Make_, and the
result is a development workflow that they can use on any machine, from a tiny
Raspberry Pi to a giant supercomputer. If they want to use an IDE after that,
nothing will stop them, and they will better understand what an IDE actually
does.

Why Make
********

Make_ is one of the oldest build tools around. It was developed by Marty
Feldmann back in 1976, who wanted to speed up command line work (that was all
we had back then). His tool did an amazing job of doing that, and it has been in
use actively ever since. In fact some IDE systems just end up being a wrapper
around Make_ which does the real work.

Because it is so common, I use Make_ rather than one of the newer build tools.
A quick search on GitHub_ showed 56 million Makefiles were available for study.
I think that number speaks for itself!

Writing Makefiles
*****************

Make_ depends on a single text file called ``Makefile`` or ``makefile`` to
control what it does. There are many ways to set up Make_ in a project, and
some end up with a ``Makefile`` in every directory. A top-level Makefile can be
used to build an entire project using this scheme. Other developers like one
top-lebel Makefile`` to control every aspect of building and managing their
projects.

Because I teach beginning software development courses, I keep to the single
``Makefile`` style. As the project grows in size, so does the size of this
``Makefile``! So, I began looking for ways to better manage the ``Makefile``
itself. It turns out to be easy to do this, but getting things set up for
student use took a bit of research and thinking!

Modular Make
************

What I came up with, and this is by no means original to me, is the idea of
breaking up a long ``Makefile`` into a set of focuses component files, all of
which are included in a single top-level `Makefile`` that ends up fairly small.
Any project can be set up by copying this one file into the right place, then
selecting the Make_ modules needed for that project.
I have been teaching students how to build projects using the ``command line``
on all major platforms for years. I also introduce them to the ``Gnu Make`` tool, a
powerful build tool used by millions of developers. Sadly, I am in the minority
when it comes ot getting students set up to work this way.

This project is an effort to modularize a ``Makefile`` suitable for use in my
Python, C/C++, and Computer Architecture classes. The basic setup should work
on any platform with no changes.

Project Structure
******************

Use of this ``Makefile`` setup assumes a basic project organization that should be
usable for most student projects, even fairly large ones. The system needs
Python to perform some of the magic, since many ``Make`` setups depend on features
only available to builders working on Mac/Linux systems. I decided to add a few
small Python scripts, driven by ``Make`` to get some things done.

Here is the basic project setup I use:

..  code-block:: text

    +- ProjectName
        |
        +- src/ - holds user part of application
        |
        +- lib/ - all application components live here
        |
        +- include/ - header files
        |
        +- tests/ - unit tests
        |
        +- rst/ - reStructuredText documentation (Sphinx)
        |
        +- docs/ - html pages published on GitHub

Required Tools
**************

This system assumes that you are using a fairly common set of build tools.
Specifically, these tools should all be installed and able to be run from a
``command line`` shell:

    * ``Gnu Make`` - the build tool
    * ``Gnu C/C++`` - modern compiler tool set
    * ``Python 3+`` (3.7 currently) - used for documentation and ``make`` helper scripts
    * ``Git`` - source code management
