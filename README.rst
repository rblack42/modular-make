A Makefile system designed to be used by students learning Python and C/C++
programming. This tool is being used by my students at Austin Community College
on all major platforms.

Documentation
*************

Documentation for this project is produced using the Python Sphinx tools. Of
course, the ``Makefile`` does alll the hard work. The resulting html files are
visible on Github at the above URL.

Installatiob
************

Clone this repo into a suitable folder on your system. The project-level
Lakefile will need to be modified so it points to this folder.
